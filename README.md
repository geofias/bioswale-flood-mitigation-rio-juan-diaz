# Bioswale Suitability for Flood Mitigation in Rio Juan Díaz Basin

This project aims to evaluate the suitability of the Rio Juan Díaz basin for implementing bioswales as a flood mitigation strategy. Bioswales, which are landscape elements designed to concentrate and convey stormwater runoff while promoting infiltration and reducing flooding, can play a crucial role in reducing flood risk. By using advanced geospatial analysis in ArcGIS Pro, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of the area's flood and landslide susceptibility to create a model for bioswale suitability.

## Outcomes and Impact
The project provides a clear roadmap for implementing bioswales in the Rio Juan Díaz basin to reduce flood risk. By identifying high-risk areas and suggesting suitable locations for bioswale construction, this project offers a practical solution to a significant environmental challenge. The recommendations from this project can guide future flood mitigation efforts in similar regions, contributing to enhanced resilience and sustainability.
